Pandas has been one of the most commonly used tools for Data Science and Machine learning, which is used for data cleaning and analysis. 
Here, Pandas is the best tool for handling this real-world messy data. 

Pandas is built on top of two core Python librariesâ€”matplotlib for data visualization and NumPy for mathematical operations. 
Pandas acts as a wrapper over these libraries, allowing you to access many of matplotlib's and NumPy's methods with less code.
