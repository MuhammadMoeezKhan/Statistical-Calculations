# Statistical-Calculations


#### I programmed a Python project to demonstrate the use of the Pandas Python library and analyze existing data statistically.
<br>

#### Program utilizes:

- Delimiter: separator of content while parsing a file -->  regex

- Headers: data file --> row numbers

- Name: array --> data file --> column names

- Row Number Count: number of lines to read in the data file

#### Program functionalities:

- Calculates statistical data relationships: mean, mode, median, and standard deviation via z-scores

- Standardizes the entire data collection use data z-scores
